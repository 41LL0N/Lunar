After changing the mandatory configuration options, open the command line and head over to the root folder of the bot. This can be done by using the `cd C:\insert\path\to\folder\here\` command. Once in the root folder, launch the bot by using the `node bot.js` command.

The bot can be shut down by terminating the command line or using the following key-press combination when the command line is focussed `CTRL + C`.
