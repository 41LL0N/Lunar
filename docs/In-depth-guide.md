So you think of yourself as an advanced user? Then it's probably for the best to dive straight in without further a do.

### **How to set up Lunar - the advanced way**
**0** - It is strongly recommended to go through the steps detailed in the [quick-start guide](./Quick-start-guide.md) as this is a continuation rather than an alternative way of setting up Lunar.

**1** - The `!settings` command allows you to modify any configuration option there is for a server. Example: `!settings commands` is the endpoint to change settings related to the commands feature. A more concrete example that disables the `!about` command would be: `!settings commands about enabled false`. Omitting an argument will return an embed containing possible arguments to use.

**2** - That's it! The `!settings` command is your way of specifically adjusting certain settings that aren't possible through the `!setup` command. For example, this can be used to clear the list of Welcome Message responses or add one of your own.
